# SomÄ“'s utility scripts

Here are some utility scripts I wrote for myself. At first I wanted to write the scripts in a shell scripting language. But then I discovered [Babashka](https://github.com/babashka/babashka) and I love Clojure. I decided to port all the scripts to Clojure instead. You will need [Babashka](https://github.com/babashka/babashka) to run these scripts.

## Installation
You need to first [install Babashka](https://github.com/babashka/babashka#quickstart). 
 ```sh
 git clone https://github.com/somecho/utility-scripts
 cd utility-scripts
 ./install.clj 
 ```
 This will copy all the scripts into `~/.local/bin`. Make sure `~/.local/bin` is in your path to call the scripts globally.
 
### Uninstalling
 To uninstall, simply call `uninstall-some-scripts` and all the scripts will be deleted from `~/.local/bin`.
 
 ## Scripts
### [cljminimal](./cljminimal.clj)
A script to create an ultraminimal clj project with an empty deps.edn and a singular hello world main function. To use, simply call `cljminimal my-minimal-clj-project` and a project called `my-minimal-clj-project` will be created for you. Mainly used for quick hacking and throwaway prototyping.

### [keepbooks](./keepbooks.clj)
A helper script to enter a transaction into a [Ledger](https://github.com/ledger/ledger) file. The script has the following format:
```sh
keepbooks -f LEDGERFILE DATE PAYEE ACCOUNT_TO_DEBIT ACCOUNT_TO_CREDIT AMOUNT CURRENCY
```
You can ommit the `DATE` field. You can also ommit both `DATE` and `PAYEE` fields, but you _cannot_ ommit the `PAYEE` field and not the `DATE` field. Valid commands:
```sh
keepbooks -f LEDGERFILE DATE PAYEE ACCOUNT_TO_DEBIT ACCOUNT_TO_CREDIT AMOUNT CURRENCY
keepbooks -f LEDGERFILE PAYEE ACCOUNT_TO_DEBIT ACCOUNT_TO_CREDIT AMOUNT CURRENCY # date ommitted
keepbooks -f LEDGERFILE ACCOUNT_TO_DEBIT ACCOUNT_TO_CREDIT AMOUNT CURRENCY # date AND payee ommitted
```
Upon entering a successful command, the ledger entry will be written into the ledger file provided and also printed out in the commandline.
```sh
keepbooks -f 2023.ledger 2023/07/20 Sushi Expenses:Restaurant Assets:Bank 30.00 EUR
# prints out:
# 2023/07/20 Sushi
#  Expenses:Restaurant                       30.00 EUR
#  Assets:Bank
```
At the moment, the payee field cannot contain spaces [#1](https://github.com/somecho/utility-scripts/issues/1). 
### [startnewtask](./startnewtask.clj)
Creates and immediately starts a [Taskwarrior](https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/taskwarrior) task. Use this as you would `task add`.
```sh
task add +admin +bookkeeping track finance # adds a task to Taskwarrior
startnewtask +admin +bookkeeping track finance # adds and starts task
```
### [stoptasks](./stoptasks.clj)

Stops all active [Taskwarrior](https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/taskwarrior) tasks. Every tried `task stop` and gotten an error? Yeah, me too. Now you can stop all active tasks with a single `stoptasks`.
