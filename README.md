# SomÄ“'s utility scripts

Here are some utility scripts I wrote for myself. At first I wanted to write the scripts in a shell scripting language. But then I discovered [Babashka](https://github.com/babashka/babashka) and I love Clojure. I decided to port all the scripts to Clojure instead. You will need [Babashka](https://github.com/babashka/babashka) to run these scripts.

## Scripts
### [cljminimal](./cljminimal.clj)
A script to create an ultraminimal clj project with an empty deps.edn and a singular hello world main function. To use, simply call `./cljminimal.clj my-minimal-clj-project` and a project called `my-minimal-clj-project` will be created for you. Mainly used for quick hacking and throwaway prototyping.
### [startnewtask](./startnewtask.clj)
Creates and immediately starts a [Taskwarrior](https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/taskwarrior) task. Use this as you would `task add`.
```sh
task add +admin +bookkeeping track finance # adds a task to Taskwarrior
./startnewtask.clj +admin +bookkeeping track finance # adds and starts task
```
### [stoptasks](./stoptasks.clj)
Stops all active [Taskwarrior](https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/taskwarrior) tasks. Every tried `task stop` and gotten an error? Yeah, me too. Now you can stop all active tasks with a single `./stoptasks.clj`.
## Usage suggestion
You could copy the scripts to `/usr/local/bin` or to any other directories that are in your `PATH`. It will then be globally accessible.
